    "natural_language_example": "A company produces multiple products, each with a specific profit margin (c_j), resource usage (1/a_j), and production capacity limit (u_j). The company aims to maximize its total profit while ensuring that the total resource usage does not exceed a given budget (b). The decision variables (X_j) represent the quantity of each product to produce, constrained by their respective production limits."
