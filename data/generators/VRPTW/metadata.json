    "natural_language_example": "A logistics company needs to deliver goods to 10 customers using a fleet of vehicles. Each customer has a specific demand, a time window during which they must be served, and a service time required for delivery. The vehicles have a limited capacity, and the goal is to minimize the total distance traveled while ensuring that all customers are served within their time windows and that the vehicle capacity is not exceeded. For example, Customer A must be served between 9:00 AM and 11:00 AM, has a demand of 5 units, and requires 15 minutes for service. The company must determine the optimal routes for the vehicles to meet all constraints."
