    "natural_language_example": "A car sharing service needs to assign vehicles to members for a particular time slot. For example:\n* 5 participants with different car preferences:\n  - Alice: interested in sedan and SUV\n  - Bob: only wants electric vehicles\n  - Carol: prefers compact cars\n  - David: interested in any vehicle type\n  - Eve: only wants automatic transmission\n* 5 available cars:\n  - Car 1: Electric Sedan\n  - Car 2: Compact Manual\n  - Car 3: SUV Automatic\n  - Car 4: Hybrid Sedan\n  - Car 5: Electric SUV\n\nThe system needs to:\n1. Match participants to cars based on their preferences\n2. Ensure each participant gets at most one car\n3. Ensure each car is assigned to at most one participant\n4. Maximize the total number of successful assignments while respecting all participants' preferences"
