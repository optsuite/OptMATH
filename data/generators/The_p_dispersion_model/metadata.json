    "natural_language_example": "Suppose you are tasked with selecting 3 facilities from 10 candidate locations such that the minimum distance between any two selected facilities is maximized. The distances between the locations are known, and the goal is to ensure that the facilities are as dispersed as possible to avoid overlap or interference."
