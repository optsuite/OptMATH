    "natural_language_example": "Suppose you are planning a road trip from City A to City B. Each road between cities has a specific travel time (cost). The goal is to find the route from City A to City B that minimizes the total travel time. This is an example of the Shortest Path Problem, where cities are nodes, roads are arcs, and travel times are arc costs."
