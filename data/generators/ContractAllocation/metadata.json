    "natural_language_example": "A manufacturing company needs to allocate production contracts to multiple factories. For example:\n* 3 production facilities with different capabilities:\n  - Factory A: capacity 1000 units, minimum batch size 100 units\n  - Factory B: capacity 1500 units, minimum batch size 200 units\n  - Factory C: capacity 800 units, minimum batch size 150 units\n* 4 contracts to be fulfilled:\n  - Contract 1: 500 units, requires at least 2 suppliers\n  - Contract 2: 800 units, requires at least 1 supplier\n  - Contract 3: 1200 units, requires at least 3 suppliers\n  - Contract 4: 600 units, requires at least 2 suppliers\n* Production costs vary by factory and contract due to:\n  - Transportation distances\n  - Equipment compatibility\n  - Labor costs\n\nThe goal is to:\n1. Minimize total production and delivery costs\n2. Ensure all contracts are fully fulfilled\n3. Respect factory capacity limits\n4. Meet minimum delivery sizes\n5. Satisfy minimum supplier requirements for each contract"
