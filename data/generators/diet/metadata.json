    "natural_language_example": "A hospital needs to plan a diet for patients that meets specific nutritional requirements while minimizing the cost of purchasing food. The diet must include at least 10 units of protein, 20 units of carbohydrates, and 5 units of fat, but no more than 50 units of protein, 100 units of carbohydrates, and 30 units of fat. The hospital can choose from a variety of foods, each with a specific cost, nutrient content, and purchase limits. The goal is to determine the optimal amount of each food to buy to meet the nutritional requirements at the lowest cost."
