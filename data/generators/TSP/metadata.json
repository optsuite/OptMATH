    "natural_language_example": "Consider a delivery service that needs to visit 5 cities:\n* City A: Located at coordinates (0,0)\n* City B: Located at coordinates (10,20)\n* City C: Located at coordinates (20,15)\n* City D: Located at coordinates (15,5)\n* City E: Located at coordinates (5,15)\n\nThe distances between cities are measured in kilometers:\n* A to B: 22.4 km\n* B to C: 11.2 km\n* C to D: 10.0 km\n* D to E: 14.1 km\n* E to A: 15.8 km\n\nThe goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city. This creates a 'tour' that minimizes the total travel distance. The problem becomes significantly more complex as the number of cities increases, as the number of possible routes grows factorially with n cities (n!).\n\nFor example, with just these 5 cities, starting from City A, some possible routes are:\n* A → B → C → D → E → A\n* A → E → D → C → B → A\n* A → B → E → C → D → A\n\nThe challenge is to determine which of all possible routes has the minimum total distance."
