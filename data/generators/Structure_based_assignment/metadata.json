    "natural_language_example": "Consider a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy experiment where:\n* There are 10 peaks detected in the NMR spectrum\n* There are 12 amino acids in the protein sequence\n* Each peak must be matched to at most one amino acid\n* Each amino acid can be matched to at most one peak\n* Exactly 8 assignments must be made\n* Some peaks have NOE relations with other peaks (indicating they are spatially close)\n* Some amino acids are within the distance threshold of other amino acids\n\nFor example:\n* Peak 1 has an NOE relation with Peak 2\n* Amino acids A and B are 3Å apart (below the 5Å threshold)\n* Cost of assigning Peak 1 to amino acid A is 0.2\n* Cost of assigning Peak 1 to amino acid B is 0.8\n\nThe goal is to find the assignment of peaks to amino acids that minimizes the total assignment cost while respecting the NOE constraints."
