    "description": "This problem aims to design a distribution network for a supply chain. We want to select the suppliers and warehouses locations, and decide on the amount of product transported between these locations to satisfy the customers demand. The problem elements are a) a set of nodes, ie, plants, warehouses/DCs, customers, and b) a set of links/arcs, listing pairs of nodes corresponding to allowed shipment options. Each node has a supply or demand amount and a fixed cost of including the node in the network. Each link or arc has cost/unit flow and capacity. We want to determine the facilities to use and the flow of each arc to minimize the flow cost and the fixed cost of nodes.",

The quantity of products to ship on each route\n\nAdditional constraints:\n\n- Warehouses cannot store products, they only serve as transfer points\n- All customer demands must be fully satisfied\n- The total shipments from each plant cannot exceed its capacity\n- If a warehouse is opened, the total flow through it cannot exceed its capacity\n\nThe goal is to minimize the total cost, including fixed costs of opening warehouses and variable transportation costs (cost per unit × number of units shipped on each route), while satisfying all customer demands and respecting capacity constraints."
