    "natural_language_example": "Consider a network of cities connected by roads. Each city has a certain supply of goods (e.g., food, fuel) and a certain demand for goods. The goal is to determine the optimal amount of goods to ship between cities to minimize the total shipping cost, while ensuring that the flow of goods does not exceed the capacity of the roads or the throughput capacity of the cities. For example, City A has a supply of 100 tons of goods, City B has a demand of 50 tons, and the cost of shipping goods from City A to City B is $10 per ton. The road between City A and City B has a maximum capacity of 80 tons, and City A has a maximum throughput capacity of 150 tons. The problem is to find the optimal shipment amounts that satisfy all constraints at the lowest cost."
