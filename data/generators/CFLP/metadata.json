    "natural_language_example": "A retail company needs to decide where to locate distribution centers to serve its stores. They have:\n\nPotential distribution centers:\n* Location A: capacity 1000 units, setup cost $100,000\n* Location B: capacity 800 units, setup cost $80,000\n* Location C: capacity 1200 units, setup cost $120,000\n\nStores to be served:\n* Store 1: demands 300 units, shipping cost varies by distribution center\n* Store 2: demands 400 units, shipping cost varies by distribution center\n* Store 3: demands 500 units, shipping cost varies by distribution center\n\nThe goal is to determine which distribution centers to open and how to allocate store demands to minimize total costs (setup + shipping) while respecting capacity limits of each distribution center. Each store's demand must be fully met."
