    "natural_language_example": "A nutritionist is planning a daily diet menu for a client with specific nutritional needs. For example:\n* Available foods with their nutritional content per serving:\n  - Oatmeal: 150 calories, 4g protein, $0.30/serving\n  - Chicken breast: 165 calories, 31g protein, $2.50/serving\n  - Broccoli: 55 calories, 3.7g protein, $0.80/serving\n  - Brown rice: 216 calories, 5g protein, $0.35/serving\n  - Salmon: 208 calories, 22g protein, $3.00/serving\n* Daily nutritional requirements:\n  - Calories: 1800-2200 kcal\n  - Protein: minimum 60g\n  - Carbohydrates: 200-300g\n  - Fat: maximum 70g\n\nThe goal is to:\n1. Meet all nutritional requirements\n2. Stay within volume constraints\n3. Minimize total food cost\n4. Create a feasible daily meal plan"
