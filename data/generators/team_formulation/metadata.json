Each person is assigned to only one project:\n   \\sum_{c \\in C} Assign_{p,c} = 1 \\quad \\forall p \\in P\n2. Attained skill level for each project is the maximum level of individuals assigned to the project:\n   IndividualSkill_{p,s} * Assign_{p,c} <= AttainedSkill_{c,s} \\quad \\forall p \\in P, c \\in C, s \\in S\n3. The maximum skill shortage:\n   RequiredSkill_{c,s} - AttainedSkill_{c,s} <= MaxSkillShortage \\quad \\forall c \\in C, s \\in S",
    "natural_language_example": "As a team leader, you have several projects requiring different expertise levels in different areas. You want to assign a set of people to these projects. Each person has a level of expertise in each of the areas. How to assign people to projects to minimize the maximum skill shortage from the project expertise requirement?"
