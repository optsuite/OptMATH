    "natural_language_example": "A manufacturing company needs to plan its production and inventory over the next 5 months. Each month has a specific demand for products. The company can place orders in any month, incurring a fixed cost and a variable cost per unit ordered. Holding inventory incurs a cost, and unmet demand can be backlogged at a penalty cost. The goal is to determine the optimal order quantities, inventory levels, and backlogging amounts to minimize the total cost while meeting all demands by the end of the planning horizon."
