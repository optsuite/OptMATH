    "natural_language_example": "A manufacturing plant processes three types of products through a series of operations:\n* Products to be processed:\n  - Product A: Assembly (2h), Painting (1h), Quality Check (0.5h)\n  - Product B: Assembly (1.5h), Painting (2h), Quality Check (1h)\n  - Product C: Assembly (1h), Painting (1.5h), Quality Check (0.5h)\n* Processing Requirements:\n  - Each product must go through all operations in order\n  - Only one product can be processed on a machine at a time\n  - Operations sequence: Assembly → Painting → Quality Check\n* Machine Configuration:\n  - One Assembly Station\n  - One Painting Booth\n  - One Quality Check Station\n\nThe objective is to determine the optimal sequence of products through the production line to minimize the total completion time (makespan). For example, sequence C-A-B might result in completing all products by hour 8, while sequence B-C-A might require 9 hours. The challenge is finding the sequence that results in the minimum possible completion time while respecting all processing constraints and maintaining the required operation order."
