    "natural_language_example": "An airline company needs to assign different types of aircraft to various routes to meet passenger demands while minimizing operational costs. Consider the following scenario:\n\nAircraft Types:\n* Boeing 737: 150 seats, 3 available\n* Airbus A320: 180 seats, 2 available\n* Regional Jet: 100 seats, 4 available\n\nRoutes with Daily Passenger Demand:\n* New York - Chicago: 500 passengers\n* Los Angeles - Seattle: 300 passengers\n* Miami - Boston: 400 passengers\n\nOperating Costs ($ per flight):\n* Boeing 737:\n  - New York - Chicago: $12,000\n  - Los Angeles - Seattle: $15,000\n  - Miami - Boston: $13,500\n* Airbus A320:\n  - New York - Chicago: $14,000\n  - Los Angeles - Seattle: $17,000\n  - Miami - Boston: $15,500\n* Regional Jet:\n  - New York - Chicago: $8,000\n  - Los Angeles - Seattle: $10,000\n  - Miami - Boston: $9,500\n\nThe airline must decide how many of each aircraft type to assign to each route while:\n* Not exceeding the available number of each aircraft type\n* Meeting the passenger demand on each route\n* Minimizing the total operational cost\n\nEach aircraft can only be assigned to one route per day, and the total capacity of assigned aircraft must meet or exceed the passenger demand for each route. The operating costs vary based on factors such as fuel consumption, distance, and aircraft efficiency on different routes.\n\nFor example, assigning 2 Boeing 737s (300 seats) and 2 Regional Jets (200 seats) to the New York - Chicago route would provide 500 seats capacity at a cost of $40,000 ($24,000 for Boeing 737s + $16,000 for Regional Jets), meeting the demand requirement of 500 passengers."
