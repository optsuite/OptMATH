    "natural_language_example": "An airline company operates a network of flights with the following scenario:\n* Available Flight Legs:\n  - NY to Chicago (200 seats)\n  - Chicago to LA (180 seats)\n  - LA to Seattle (150 seats)\n* Travel Packages:\n  - NY-Chicago Direct: $300\n    * Demand: 150 passengers\n    * Uses: NY-Chicago leg\n  - NY-LA Connection: $600\n    * Demand: 100 passengers\n    * Uses: NY-Chicago and Chicago-LA legs\n  - Chicago-Seattle Connection: $500\n    * Demand: 80 passengers\n    * Uses: Chicago-LA and LA-Seattle legs\n  - LA-Seattle Direct: $250\n    * Demand: 120 passengers\n    * Uses: LA-Seattle leg\n\nThe airline needs to:\n1. Determine how many tickets to sell for each package\n2. Maximize total revenue\n3. Ensure capacity constraints are not violated\n4. Not exceed market demand for each package\n\nFor example, they might decide to:\n- Sell 120 NY-Chicago direct tickets\n- Sell 60 NY-LA connection tickets\n- Sell 40 Chicago-Seattle connection tickets\n- Sell 90 LA-Seattle direct tickets\nResulting in optimal revenue while respecting all capacity and demand constraints."
