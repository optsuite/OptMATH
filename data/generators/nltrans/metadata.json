    "natural_language_example": "A company has three factories (origins) with supplies of 100, 200, and 150 units of a product, respectively. There are four warehouses (destinations) with demands of 80, 120, 90, and 160 units, respectively. The cost of shipping one unit from each factory to each warehouse is given, and there are limits on the number of units that can be shipped between certain pairs. The goal is to determine how many units to ship from each factory to each warehouse to minimize the total shipping cost while satisfying supply and demand constraints and respecting shipment limits."
