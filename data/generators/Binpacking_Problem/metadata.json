    "natural_language_example": "A warehouse manager needs to pack different products into identical shipping containers. The available items include:\n* Product A: weight 15kg\n* Product B: weight 25kg\n* Product C: weight 10kg\n* Product D: weight 20kg\n* Product E: weight 30kg\nEach shipping container has a maximum weight capacity of 50kg. The manager's goal is to use the minimum number of containers while ensuring all products are packed. Each product must be assigned to exactly one container, and the total weight in each container cannot exceed its capacity. For example, Product A and B could be packed together in one container (40kg total), while C and D could go in another container (30kg total), and E would need its own container."
