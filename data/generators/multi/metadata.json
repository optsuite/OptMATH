    "natural_language_example": "A company needs to transport three types of products (A, B, C) from two warehouses (Origin 1 and Origin 2) to three retail stores (Destination 1, Destination 2, and Destination 3). Each warehouse has a limited supply of each product, and each retail store has a specific demand for each product. The cost of shipping one unit of each product from a warehouse to a retail store varies. The goal is to determine the optimal amount of each product to ship from each warehouse to each retail store to minimize the total transportation cost, while ensuring that the supply and demand constraints are satisfied and that the total amount of products shipped between any warehouse and retail store does not exceed the transportation limit."
